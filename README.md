Project: SQL Database Design & Normalization<br> 
Tools: Oracle SQL, SQL*Plus<br>

# Summary
This project I did for class demonstrates designing, normalizing, and coding a healthcare appointment scheduling system
using Oracle SQL. We started from just data in a table and used that data to create 1NF to 3NF where we end up with a full relational
table and normalization database schema.
 
The database manages patients, providers, appointments, treatments, billing, and insurance information, 
demonstrating elements that reflect real-world healthcare data analysis.

# How to run
Open SQL*Plus or Oracle SQL Developer<br>  
Run the Project2inputebb.sql script to create and populate the tables<br>  
Run Project3inputebb.sql to execute updates and perform queries<br>  
Review outputs in the .txt log files to verify correctness<br>
